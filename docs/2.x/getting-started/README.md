# Introduction

:rocket: Laravel Simplesheet is intended at being Laravel-flavoured Box Spout: a simple, but elegant wrapper around Box Spout with the goal of simplifying exports and imports.

:fire: [Box Spout](http://opensource.box.com/spout/) is a library written in pure PHP and providing a set of classes that allow you to read from and to write to different spreadsheet file formats, like Excel and LibreOffice Calc.

**Laravel Simplesheet Features:**

* Easily export collections to Excel.
* Export queries with automatic chunking for better performance.
* Queue exports for better performance.
* Easily import to collections.
* Handle the import inserts in batches.

## Credits

This package uses a lot of code copied from [Laravel Excel](https://laravel-excel.maatwebsite.nl) and probably wouldn't exist without it, so a big thanks to the Laravel Excel team for their work on that amazing package. Make sure to check it out!
